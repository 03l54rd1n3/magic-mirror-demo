##Step 1: Cabinet + 2-way mirror

##Step 2: Drilling

Drill a hole on the top of the cabinet for the camera as displayed in the image below. Make sure the hole is big enough for the USB end to go through.

On the back of the cabinet almost at the botom, drill another hole so you can pass the power cables through.

##Step 3: Making the monitor lean

Remove the outer casing of the monitor without damaging the touch sensor as seen on the picture below. You can use the pliers to cut the sensor panel off the outer casing. You will need this sensor to control the power settings of the monitor. It should look like the image below.

Cover the edges of the naked monitor with the black tape.

##Step 4: Supporting the monitor

The monitor legs place the mirror as close to the mirror as possible. You can find the 3D model of the legs here. 

You can 3d print the legs on [3D Hubs](https://www.3dhubs.com/), or, if you have a 3D printer, you can print them yourself. If you don't want to 3D print anything, you use toilet paper rolls. Cut them so they are 3 inches tall. 

The cabinet has holes along the sides. Use the screws to secure the monitor legs to the cabinets using those holes.
